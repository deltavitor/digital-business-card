      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I'm a Computer Science student from Brazil, currently a product design intern. I'm a developer in my free time, and I'm particularly interested in all things development related, from front and back-end to competitive programming. I also like to incorporate human-centered in what I do as developer, and am constantly looking for new things to learn.</p>
